üìå How to Use
1. Prepare Your Data
Copy the log files from your RadiosondeAutoRX folder into a new folder.

Also include a copy of the station.cfg file in the same folder.

Copy a portion of the logs to the folder.

Do this until all logs have been processed.

2. Update the Database

Click Update Database to process and store data in your browser's IndexedDB.
